# transcend_data_silo_connection (Resource)



## Example Usages

### Connecting an AWS Silo

Connecting Amazon to Transcend is done through [AWS IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html). In any AWS Account you want us to have access to audit, you need to create an IAM Role allowing our AWS organization access to it. This is the recommended pattern from Amazon [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html). This is done in a few steps:

- You create an AWS data silo in Transcend.
- We provide you with an external id through a resource output
- You create an IAM Policy for what permissions Transcend can take in your organization
- You create an IAM Role that only allows Transcend to access it, and only when using the given external ID

```terraform
resource "transcend_data_silo" "aws" {
  type        = "amazonWebServices"
  description = "Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides information technology infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services."

  # Normally, Data Silos are connected in this resource. But for AWS, we want to delay connecting until after
  # we create the IAM Role, which must use the `aws_external_id` output from this resource. So instead, we set
  # `skip_connecting` to `true` here and use a `transcend_data_silo_connection` resource below
  skip_connecting = true
  lifecycle { ignore_changes = [plaintext_context] }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "iam_role" {
  name        = "TranscendAWSIntegrationRole2"
  description = "Policy to allow Transcend access to this AWS Account"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        // 829095311197 is the AWS Organization for Transcend that will try to assume role into your organization
        Principal = { AWS = "arn:aws:iam::829095311197:root" }
        Condition = { StringEquals = { "sts:ExternalId" : transcend_data_silo.aws.aws_external_id } }
      },
    ]
  })

  inline_policy {
    name = "TranscendPermissions"
    policy = jsonencode({
      Version = "2012-10-17"
      Statement = [
        {
          Action = [
            "dynamodb:ListTables",
            "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
            "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
            "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
          ]
          Effect   = "Allow"
          Resource = "*"
        },
      ]
    })
  }
}

# Give AWS Time to become consistent with the new IAM Role permissions
resource "time_sleep" "pause" {
  depends_on      = [aws_iam_role.iam_role]
  create_duration = "10s"
}

data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
resource "transcend_data_silo_connection" "connection" {
  data_silo_id = transcend_data_silo.aws.id

  plaintext_context {
    name  = "role"
    value = aws_iam_role.iam_role.name
  }

  plaintext_context {
    name  = "accountId"
    value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
  }

  depends_on = [time_sleep.pause]
}
```

The above example completes this entire flow. The `transcend_data_silo_connection` resource ensures that the IAM Role is assumable by Transcend.

## Schema

### Required

- `data_silo_id` (String) The ID of the data silo to connect

### Optional

- `plaintext_context` (Block Set) This is where you put non-secretive values that go in the form when connecting a data silo (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--plaintext_context))

### Read-Only

- `connection_state` (String) The current state of the integration
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--plaintext_context"></a>
### Nested Schema for `plaintext_context`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the plaintext input
- `value` (String) The value of the plaintext input

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import transcend_data_silo_connection.connection <data_silo_id_from_silo_url>
```
